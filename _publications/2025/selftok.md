  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-Consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). Selftok is a SOTA tokenizer that achieves both high-quality reconstruction and high compression bit rate. After representing the training images as Selftok tokens, as a pure AR model, our VLM achieves both SOTA visual comprehension and generation performances.
