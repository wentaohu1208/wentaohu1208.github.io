  # With the rise of large language models and chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning has shown strong potential for deep reasoning in multi-task scenarios. However, existing unified models lack end-to-end integration of image generation and understanding, limiting self-reflection and cross-modal reasoning. We propose Vinic, a framework that enables interleaved image generation and understanding via deep reasoning. Vinic leverages a small amount of multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) data for cold start and reinforcement learning with a momentum-based reward to stabilize multi-round optimization. Experiments show that integrating MCoT improves Geneval performance by +22%, significantly boosting image quality and instruction alignment.
